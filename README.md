# inkscape-thunderlaser
Simple inkscape extension to export rdcam files that can be sent to a laser with a rudia controller.

Using svg to path conversion from inkscape-paths2openscad from inkcscape-cookiecutter from eggbot.
Added support for rounded corners in rectangles. Most other exporter export all
rectangles with sharp corners and ignore any radius specified in the svg file.
